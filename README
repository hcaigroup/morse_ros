This is the ROS-stack for the MORSE-simulator. Currently it provides bindings for the navigation stack and for broadcasting tfs using the robot state-publisher and simulator truepose.

This stack is still under development. If have any questions or would like to join developing, donÂ´t hesitate to contact me here:
